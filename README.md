# Computer Vision with OpenCV 3 and Qt5
This is the code repository for [Computer Vision with OpenCV 3 and Qt5](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/computer-vision-opencv-3-and-qt5?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788472395), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Developers have been using OpenCV library to develop computer vision applications for a long time. However, they now need a more effective tool to get the job done and in a much better and modern way. Qt is one of the major frameworks available for this task at the moment.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapter 11 has no code file, rest all chapter code files are present in their respective folder.

The code will look like the following:
```
#include "mainwindow.h"
#include
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  QApplication a(argc, argv);
  MainWindow w;
  w.show();
  return a.exec();
}
```

Although every required tool and software, the correct version, and how it is installed and configured is covered in the initial chapters of the book, the following is a list that can be used as a quick reference:
  * A regular computer with a more recent version of Windows, macOS, or Linux (such as Ubuntu) operating system installed on it.
  * Microsoft Visual Studio (on Windows)
  * Xcode (on macOS)
  * CMake
  * Qt Framework
  * OpenCV Framework
To get an idea of what a regular computer is these days, you can search online or ask a local
shop; however, the one you already have is most probably enough to get you started.
